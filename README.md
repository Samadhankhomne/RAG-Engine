# RAG-Engine
Developed and implemented advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance AI model performance. Leveraged ChromaDB, LangChain, and Transformers for seamless integration of retrieval mechanisms with generative models. Focused on optimizing retrieval pipelines, handling unstructured data, and delivering contextually accurate outputs. 
 This project includes a comprehensive code repository and resources from a hands-on RAG workshop, exploring the fusion of retrieval methods and generative AI for improved contextual understanding.
