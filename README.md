# RAG-Engine
A workshop repository for implementing advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. This project leverages ChromaDB, LangChain, and Transformers to demonstrate how to enhance AI capabilities by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models. Includes handling unstructured data and optimizing retrieval pipelines.
    This repository contains code and resources for a workshop on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), exploring how to combine retrieval methods with generative models to produce contextually accurate and informative outputs.
